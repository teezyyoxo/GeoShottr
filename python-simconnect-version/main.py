# =======================
# MSFS Screenshot EXIF Updater
# Version 1.2.1
# By PBandJamf AKA TeezyYoxO
# =======================

# CHANGELOG #

# Version 1.2.1:
# - **Fixed SimConnect data retrieval issues**: Improved handling of live location data retrieval, ensuring that values for latitude, longitude, and altitude are properly fetched.
# - **Handled None values more effectively**: Now properly skips the metadata update for screenshots if live data is invalid (i.e., None values for location data).
# - **Improved error handling for metadata saving**: Addressed issues where the image file would fail to save due to invalid PNG metadata or other file-related errors.
# - **Fixed issue with test flag (`-t`, `--test`, `-T`)**: Ensured that the test mode outputs valid live location data as intended without attempting to process screenshots.
# - **Added better feedback for users**: The script now provides more meaningful messages when skipping screenshots due to invalid location data or missing EXIF metadata.
# - **Improved handling for corrupted image files**: Prevents errors when attempting to process or save images with invalid PNG metadata.
# - **Enhanced logging and error messages**: Added more detailed logging to help identify issues with live data retrieval, screenshot processing, and metadata saving.

# Version 1.2.0:
# - **Added `-t`, `--test`, and `-T` flags**: These flags now allow running the script in "test mode" which only prints live location data from the simulator (latitude, longitude, altitude).
# - Integrated **`argparse`** for better command-line argument parsing.
# - If the test mode is selected, the script **connects to MSFS** and prints the **live location data** without processing screenshots.
# - If no test flag is passed, the script continues with its regular functionality, which includes monitoring directories for new screenshots and embedding GPS metadata into them.

# Version 1.1.3:
# - Fixed issue with broken PNG file when trying to write EXIF metadata.
# - Switched to embedding GPS data in custom text chunks (using the `Description` field) for PNG files.
# - Ensured that PNG files' integrity is preserved by avoiding direct modification of EXIF data, which is not native to PNG format.
# - Added fallback handling for storing GPS data in a format compatible with PNG metadata.
# - Improved error handling for cases where the image format is not supported or the file is corrupted.

# Version 1.1.2:
# - Fixed issue with GPS EXIF metadata not being correctly written to PNG files.
# - Manually mapped GPS data to the proper EXIF tags using the correct `GPSTAGS` values.
# - Improved handling for missing GPSInfo tag in EXIF and added more comprehensive error messages.
# - Ensured that GPS data is added properly even if the EXIF metadata doesn't initially contain a GPS tag.

# Version 1.1.1:
# - Fixed issue where GPS data was not correctly added to the EXIF metadata.
# - Updated EXIF handling to ensure GPS metadata is written under the correct tag (`GPSInfo`).
# - Added better error handling for missing EXIF tags and issues during save operation.
# - Ensured that only valid GPS keys are used in the EXIF data.

# Version 1.1.0:
# - Added support for monitoring multiple directories.
# - Limited file processing to `.png` files containing "Microsoft Flight Simulator" in their names.
# - Updated dynamic logging to print the actual monitored directories.
# - Prints the full path and location data when a new screenshot is detected.

# Version 1.0.0:
# - Initial release.
# - Connects to MSFS using SimConnect.
# - Retrieves latitude, longitude, and altitude data.
# - Monitors a specified folder for new screenshots.
# - Adds location data to screenshot EXIF metadata.
#   
# Future Plans:
# - Automate taking screenshots directly from the script.
# - Add user-configurable settings for screenshot folder and EXIF fields.
# - Handle non-image files more gracefully.
