### THE SIMCONNECT VERSION IS THE ONLY FUNCTIONAL VERSION FOR RIGHT NOW :) --dev 16.1.2025

# Geoshottr

**Geoshottr** is a Python-based tool that automatically adds geolocation metadata (latitude, longitude, and altitude) to your Microsoft Flight Simulator screenshots. It detects screenshots saved by the game, retrieves aircraft location data, and embeds the information into the images, so you can view them on a map or use them in photo apps that support geotagging.

---

## Features

- **Geolocation Tagging**: Adds latitude, longitude, and altitude metadata to screenshots.
- **PNG to JPEG Conversion**: Automatically converts PNG screenshots to JPEG format while preserving metadata.
- **Custom Folder Support**: Monitors one or more directories for new screenshots, with geotagging support.
- **EXIF Metadata**: Embeds GPS data into EXIF metadata (suitable for mapping applications like Google Photos and Apple Photos).
- **Clean Exit**: Handles interruptions gracefully without errors or incomplete file saves.

# Planned upcoming features
## Future Plans:
- Automate taking screenshots directly from the script.
- Create/add a UI (initially, will be a System Tray icon, but would ultimately like to integrate directly into the sim's in-flight toolbar to initiate the whole process of the script, but I am satisfied with how it works for now).
- ~~Executable + tray icon~~ *in-development*
- Automatic startup with sim â€“ would love help with this!
- Figure out a way to preserve image quality when converting down from the uncompressed PNG to JPEG (or a completely different approach to this whole issue).
- Add user-configurable settings for screenshot folder and EXIF fields, either in the in-game UI, a "verify settings" dialog box that is produced at launch, or something from the System Tray. Possibly via tray icon?
- Optimize, optimize, optimize.
- Handle non-PNG files more gracefully.
- Actual support for NVIDIA's "Super Resolution" screenshots.
- NVIDIA Capture SDK integration for closer-to-native screenshot handling.
- Full-resolution geotagged screenshots; currently, the script converts the full-res to JPEG. See "how it works" for more info.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package manager)

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```git clone https://github.com/teezyyoxo/geoshottr.git``` 

2.  Navigate to the project folder:   
    `cd geoshottr/python-simconnect-version` 
    
3.  Install required dependencies: 
    `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
    
4.  (Optional) Set up an `.env` file to configure your screenshot directories:
    - `SCREENSHOT_PATH_1="C:/path/to/screenshot/folder"`
    - `SCREENSHOT_PATH_2="D:/another/folder"`

## Usage

1.  Ensure Microsoft Flight Simulator is running and taking screenshots.
    
2.  Run the script:
    `python main.py` 
    
3.  The script will:
    -   Monitor specified screenshot directories for new images.
    -   Extract GPS data from Microsoft Flight Simulator (lat, long, altitude).
    -   Convert PNG screenshots to JPEG (if necessary) and save them in a subfolder `Geotagged`.
    -   Add EXIF geolocation metadata to the images.
4.  You should see the geotagged images in the designated folder, ready for mapping or use in photo apps.
    
----------

## Configuration

By default, the script monitors two directories:

-   `S:/MSFS Recordings/Microsoft Flight Simulator`
-   `C:/Users/YourUsername/Videos/Captures`

To customize these directories, create a `.env` file in the project root directory and set the paths using the variables `SCREENSHOT_PATH_1`, `SCREENSHOT_PATH_2`, etc.

Example `.env` file:

`SCREENSHOT_PATH_1="C:/Users/YourUsername/Documents/FS2020_Screenshots"
 SCREENSHOT_PATH_2="E:/FlightSimScreenshots"` 

----------

## How does it work?

~~Simple.~~
The script runs in the background, monitoring the specified folders for new screenshots from the sim.
It actively reads data lat/long/alt directly from SimConnect.
When a screenshot is taken, the script "catches" it.
The "captured" screenshot (PNG, which *does not* have EXIF support) is then converted to a JPEG (which *does* have EXIF support).
Because the python-simconnect version (along with the current executable) utilizes the PIL ("Pillow") module for doing this, the output file is usually noticeably lower in quality as it has less color depth than the original. 
If you know of a better way to do this, please submit an Issue or PR, because I would love to improve this for everyone. I love my full-res screenshots (#SimPhotographer), but I'm beginning to appreciate seeing a map with receipts of my past flights much more than knowing I can color-grade the original.
Let's work together? :D

## Changelog

### Version 1.6.1.2 (hopefully this versioning makes sense by now)
- Added some debugging; the actual operations are not running when the executable is run standalone.
*... or so I think.*
Stay tuned.

### Version 1.5.1.2 (script v1.5 + executable v1.2)
- Corrected path definition to images/icons and such for executable.
- Added path for X-Plane screenshots to screenshot_dirs.

### Version 1.4.1.1 (script v1.4 + executable v1.1)
- Attempted to fix issue of script not terminating with ctrl+c in console, but am getting nowhere. 
- Both the script and executable both work beautifully as-is.
- Onward and upward from here on out.

### Version 1.3a1.0 (script v1.3a + executable v1.0)
- Adjusted the thread function call to main instead of one that is nonexistent.

### Version 1.3.1.0 (script v1.3 + executable v1.0 = en juntos "v1.3.1.0")
- Added System Tray integration using PyStray.
- Script now runs in a separate thread (for more herspers).
- Right-click menu in the System Tray allows for graceful exit.
- System Tray icon supports custom icons (icon_image var).

### Version 1.2.6
- Restored normal operation -- script now writes EXIF data to the down-converted JPEG again. Sorry about breaking that!
- Back to square one with handling Super Resolution screenshots. Oy vey...

### Version 1.2.5
- Fixed processing of super-resolution screenshots to handle both large and standard images effectively.
- Added validation for PNG and other image types when using OpenCV for super-resolution images.
- Reworked error handling during image loading and EXIF data insertion to avoid unexpected script failures.

### Version 1.2.4
- Initial NVIDIA "Super Resolution" screenshot support
* Added OpenCV handling for "super-resolution" screenshots (e.g., 5120x2880 from NVIDIA overlay).
- Updated EXIF geotagging: Enhanced EXIF update with GPS data (latitude, longitude, altitude).
- Fallback on missing data: Skips EXIF update if location data is missing.

- Created EXIF data from scratch with GPS coordinates, altitude, and description.
- Simplified handling of PNG to JPEG conversion with EXIF insertion.
- Ensured smoother workflow for screenshots without EXIF data.
- Realized that the EXIF standard uses DMS and there is no way to get around it. A custom EXIF field with the converted value would work, but... kinda pointless.

### Version 1.2.3.1

- Now the script creates an empty EXIF structure if none exists and adds GPS data.
- Improved robustness against missing or incomplete EXIF data during the metadata update process.
- Ensured that GPS data is correctly embedded in JPEG files even when EXIF metadata is initially absent.

### Version 1.2.2

- Implemented graceful handling of `KeyboardInterrupt` to exit the script without printing stack traces.

### Version 1.1.4:
- The script now handles KeyboardInterrupt to exit cleanly without printing stack traces.
- Addressed the issue where PNG files failed to save due to broken metadata. Now, location data is embedded as a custom text chunk under the `Description` field.
- Cleaned up the code for better handling of PNG metadata saving.

### Version 1.1.3:
- Fixed issue with broken PNG file when trying to write EXIF metadata.
- Switched to embedding GPS data in custom text chunks (using the `Description` field) for PNG files.
